# Full-Stack-Web-Application-SENG365
This repo contains the first and second assignments for the web architectures course SENG365 at the University of Canterbury. The backend uses NodeJS and an external database to process various API requests. The front uses VueJS for a petitions website.

Note: The backend connects to an external university database without my creditentials in the config files for obvious reasons. Therefore this application cannot currently be ran. However, I will fix this in the near future.
